<p> My dad needs a computer that can run four virtal machines. This will require a lot of ram and a fast CPU. It will also require an ethernet port, and a monitor is necessary. If it is portable, my dad can easily bring it on business trips. </p>

<p> Both computers have their simularities and differences, as well as advantages and disadvantages. Both computes aren't exactly portable, and both need a sperate monitor, as well as a seperate mouse and a sperate keyboard. If I were to have chosen a laptop, it wouldn't have been able to support the virtual machines. They both havethe ethernet ports, however the HP computer also has fast ethernet and gigbit ethernet, which could help the virtual machines run faster. The Dell computer, though more expensive, has way more default ram than the HP, however you can buy additional ram for the HP, which would bring the price up. </p>
