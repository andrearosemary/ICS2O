	<h1> Cyber-bullying. The dark truth on the other side of the screen. </h1>
	
	<h5> CYBERBULLY [CB] HAS COME ONLINE </h5>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: These days, everything is online. Why would you call a friend if you can send a message to them in a fraction of the time? Why would you read the newspaper when you can just check your favourite social media for the latest news? Why would you tell someone your mean opinions about them to their face when you can do it anonmynously without leaving your couch? Why would you go to the mall when you can buy clothes online? <p>
	
	<h5> CYBERFIGHTER [CF] HAS COME ONLINE </h5>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue> CF: Why would anyone tell someone their mean opinions on them? Online or otherwise? </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: Online is way more effective. After all, if someone posts a picture of themself looking like a freak, doesn't that give me permission to tell them that they look like a freak? </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue> CF: What! No! How would you feel if you posted of yourself you thought look good in and someone commented on it saying mean things? </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: Well, I dunno what I'd do. <br><br> CB: Why would anyone ever do that. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: You were just saying you'd that. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: I'll just delete my messages. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: There will still be proof that you said that on your computer. <br><br> CF: Just like when you send a snapchat to someone. It seems to disappear after a few seconds, but the photo is saved on both of your phones, even if neither of you screenshotted it. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: WHAT? </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: It gets worst with Snapchat. That "private" picture you sent to your boyfriend can be saved and sent to everyone you know. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: But I trust my boyfriend. Especially with my snaps. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: Until you break up. <br><br> CF: Then he can send the pictures to everyone at school. And then it can spread all across the city. And there is no way to ever get it off the Internet. <br><br> CF: And everyone will be making fun of that embarassing picture. Online and irl. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CB: If that were to happen to me I'd kill myself! </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: You aren't the first. In 2011, youth 15 to 24 years made up 16.3% of deaths by suicide. Most of those were caused by some sort of bullying, mostly cyber bullying. </p>
	
	<h5> CYBERBULLY HAS CHANGED THEIR NAME TO CYBERALLY </h5>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: I decided to change my name. Cyberbullying is not a joke. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: Especially when you can get arrested for doing it. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: You have to be pulling my leg. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: December 12, 2014, Royal Assent was given to make into law, House Government Bill C-13 that was passed by the Parliament of Canada to change anti cyberbullying laws. The official title of the bill is, “An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Canada Evidence Act, the Competition Act and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.” The short title of the Bill is, "Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act." The Minister of Justice sponsored the bill. </p> 
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: What sort of things can you get in trouble with the law with? </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: Good question! Here's a list! <br><br> CF: Sent an image </p>
	
	<ol>
		<li> The distribution of intimate images (both photos and videos) without the consent of the person(s) shown in the images is now a crime in Canada. The legal term for this is, "non-consensual distribution of intimate images."
		The common term for this is "revenge porn."</li>
		<li>A Canadian court of proper jurisdiction can now compel the removal of the offending images from the Internet and charge the cyber bully with the costs of doing so.</li>
		<li>Property used in committing the offence is forfeited.</li>
		<li>A recognizance order is issued by the court to prevent distribution of the images.</li>
		<li>A convicted offender's use of a computer and the Internet is restricted.</li>
		<li>For any type of criminal cyberbullying under investigation, Police can compel Internet Service Providers to preserve information that is data about communications or tracking of transactions. </li>
		<li>For any type of criminal cyberbullying under investigation, Police can get investigative warrants easier so they may intercept private communications. This extends to all forms of telecommunications on any type of device.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: TL;DR Sending those bad pictures can land you in deep trouble. They can be kept by your internet service provider and the police can take your phone away for inestigations. If you are found guilty, your phone has to be taken away. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: Good thing these laws exist. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: But there are still no laws about making offensive comments or videos on social media. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: Oh come on! </p> 
	
	<p style=color:lightblue;> CF: Some schools have rules against cyber bullying. But none of this stops cyberbullying. So, we must take the matters in our own hands. Most social medias have block and report features. Just block the bully. If that doesn't stop them, tell someone. A parent or a teacher you can trust are the best choices. </p>
	
	<p style=color:lightpink;> CA: Let's put a stop to cyberbullying! </p>
